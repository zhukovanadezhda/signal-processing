# Signal Processing Final Project 🎶🔬

This project involves two tasks focusing on image and audio signal analysis. Below are the details and objectives for each task:

## Task 1: Analysis of Agarose Gel Image 🖼️

### Objective:
The file ```./data/IM_GCCGCC_20220329.txt``` represents the raw image of an agarose gel. The goal is to develop an algorithm that accurately identifies and measures the intensity of bands present in each well of the gel.

### Requirements:
- To implement an algorithm that minimizes the number of free parameters.
- To ensure detection of all bands, including those with low intensity.

### Output:
- **```./notebooks/gel_agarose.ipynb```**: Jupyter notebook containing the algorithm, analysis, results, and discussion for the agarose gel image analysis.
  
## Task 2: Analysis of Audio Signal with Hidden Message 🎵🔍

### Objective:
The file ```./data/IN.wav``` contains an audio signal with a hidden message embedded within it. The task is to uncover and decode this hidden message.

### Output:
- **```hidden_message.ipynb```**: Jupyter notebook containing the algorithm, analysis, results, and discussion for uncovering the hidden message in the audio signal.
